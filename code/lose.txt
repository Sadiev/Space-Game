Sorry to break it to you, but you've lost.
A Cylon named Number Six beat you in purchasing The Heart of Gold spaceship
and got to 55 Cencri e first.  You'll die in mediocrity eating TV dinners alone
for the rest of your life.  But hey, there's always next time, right?

Now get back in there and make Uncle Bobby proud.
