# Space Game Back Story

It's the year 3019 and intergalactic trade has been established between three planets in the Milky Way Galaxy: Earth, Proxima Centauri 1(4.2441 Light years from Earth), and Bernard's Star B (7.895 Light Years from Earth.)  This trade system forms a carefully balanced interdependent relationship which now governs a galactic economic system.  The three planets each have their own currency system, but the only universally recognized currency is a Cubit (roughly equivalent to $2 Earth dollars)

Earth is no longer a lush, green, wet planet, but now is a dry and grimy industrial powerhouse.  Its primary output is Styrofoam and liquid soap.  Although this seems insignificant to someone from Earth, Styrofoam is the most valuable material on the planet Bernard's Star B, and liquid soap is considered the main food source for the species of aliens (known as Cylons) living on Proxima Centauri 1.  Although Styrofoam is light, it takes up considerable space.  And liquid soap is only needed in small quantities, but it is very heavy.  

Bernard's Star B is a cold, dry, and dark planet, inhabited by short furry creatures known as ALFs.  However, they have mastered the ability for producing oatmeal cream pies, which all of the planets desire.  The planet has a natural abundance of gold, which they consider worthless on their own planet, but know that humans from Earth value it for some reason.  They primarily desire lightbulbs for not only lighting their dark planet, but as a primary food source.  The many attempts by the ALFs to manufacture lightbulbs to supply their own needs always fail; they eat them before they can develop sufficient enough quantities to fulfill demand.

Proxima Centauri 1 is a windy, wet, and warm planet inhabited by a race of beings known as Cylons.  Their chief export is lightbulbs, which the Star B's devour and pay a premium for.  Their other primary export is water; which Earth requires to survive but is extremely heavy and difficult to ship.  They subsist off liquid soap, oatmeal cream pies, and enjoy long walks on the beach.

The space game follows the story of a young, 18-year old man (either an ALF, Cylon, or Human) who's uncle Bobby died unexpectedly and left everything he had to our 18-year old hero: 1 spaceship and 500 Cubits.  The story starts with the player selecting which home planet the 18-year-old is from (Earth, Proxima Centauri 1, or Bernard's Star B).  If the player selects Earth, the spaceship he inherits is of small size but extremely fast.  If the player selects Proxima Centauri 1, the ship is extremely large, but also extremely slow.  If the player selects Bernard's Star B, the ship is of medium size and medium speed.

## Speed of Each Ship

| Ship | Warp Factor |
|------|-------|
|Earth Ship|2.000  |
|Proxima Centauri 1|1.317  |
|Bernard's Star B Ship|1.621  |

## How Much Each Ship Can Hold (in units)

| ------ | Gold | Water | Liquid Soap | Styrofoam | Oatmeal Pies | Light Bulbs |
|-----|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----|
Earth Ship| 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 10 | 5 |
PC 1 Ship| 15 | 15 | 15 | 20 | 20 | 20 |
Bernard's B Ship | 10 | 10 | 5 | 15 | 15 | 15 |

## Distance to Each Planet

|-----| Earth | PC 1  | Bernard's B |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Earth| X | 4.2441 | 7.895  |
|PC 1 | 4.2441 | X | 6.5 |
|Bernard's B| 7.895 | 6.5 | X |

The goal of the game is to obtain enough goods or money which allow our character to buy a new spaceship which he will use to discover travel to a 4th planet which is made entirely of diamonds, which all known species of aliens' desire.  Goods can be traded for the other goods listed in this document (Liquid Soap, Oatmeal Pies, Light Bulbs, Water, Gold, and Styrofoam) or outright bought and sold.  The price of goods on the planet where they are manufactured is cheap; the price on the planet where they are in high demand is expensive.

## Price of Goods on Each Planet (all prices in Cubits)

| ------ | Gold | Water | Liquid Soap | Styrofoam | Oatmeal Pies | Light Bulbs |
|-----|-------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----|
Earth| 100 | 100 | 5 | 5 | 50 | 20 |
PC 1| 50 | 5 | 100 | 20 | 100 | 5 |
Bernard's B | 5 | 50 | 20 | 100 | 5 | 100 |

## Game Play

After the user selects their character, they are at the space port on their home planet, where they can buy their initial inventory of goods (the ship will come with some random goods already loaded on the ship to start).  Once they buy the goods they want, they can then choose to fly to another planet.  During space travel, the player ages.  Once the player lands on the destination planet, they buy/trade/sell goods, and then continue the process of flying to other planets and selling/buying/trading goods.  Once the player has enough money to buy the Diamond-1 spaceship (which he can purchase at any planets spaceport) he wins the game.  If the player reaches 60 years old before purchasing the Diamond-1 spaceship, he dies, and losses the game.
